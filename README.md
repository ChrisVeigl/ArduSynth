# ArduSynth
HW/SW for low-cost Arduino-based audio synthesizers (based upon Mozzi Library).
Currently, two designs are available: one for the Arduino Nano and one for the TeensyLC microcontroller. The TeensyLC version is recommended and will be updated in the future - it offers more features like Midi control via the Teensy's usbMidi functions.

The Synthesizer sketches are based upon the "K'iin" Synthesizer by Taylan Cihan, see:

and the "Thankyou Drone Synth" by Daniel Sinderson, see:

The KICad projects (Schematics, PCB) are available in the respective HW folders, partnumbers @ digikey / Aliexpress are provided.
